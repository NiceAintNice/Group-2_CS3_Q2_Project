                    Anne Curtis advocates MCDO while being the endorser for Jollibee?!

                    It's Showtime hosts Anne Curtis and Vice Ganda made headlines again after using a prominent fast food chain's brand phrase in their on-air banter.  
                    The endorsement problem emerged when Anne, unintentionally, stated the phrase that was connected with the fast-food company that competes directly with her sponsorship. On Saturday's edition of It's Showtime, Anne accidentally said the phrase "Nice, Ganda," which was the new tagline for Vice Ganda's endorsement of McDonald's. However, it wasn't until later that she understood it was tied to the competitor of another fast-food restaurant she was advertising, which was illegal for its endorsers to do.
                    Anne quickly apologized during the live program, expressing real concern and care.
                    Did Vice Ganda do a terrible thing?!
