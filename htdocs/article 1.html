                    The series, which explored issues including substance addiction, bullying, poverty, harassment, mental health, grooming, and more, has won praise for its honest depiction of difficulties that people face in the real world.
                    "They said this program would be the first of its type when they originally approached me about it. Brillantes said, "I experienced an intense sense of enthusiasm and eagerness to be a part of it instead of any anxiety at all.
                    In her message to the audience, Andrea thanked everyone who watched Senior High, contributed ideas and material, joined Facebook groups, and helped the cast for the whole run of the show. 
                    Bullying, mental health, and poverty are all addressed, as are harassment, grooming, and other forms of abuse, as well as substance misuse.
                    I am really delighted and privileged to be a part of this performance, which bravely confronts delicate issues and increases awareness for all of us.
                    When I was initially approached about this event, they indicated that it would be the first of its type. I felt no anxiety at all; instead, I felt an incredible sense of enthusiasm and excitement about being a part of it.
